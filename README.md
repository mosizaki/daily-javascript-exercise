# JavaScript Exercises

A collection of small JavaScript projects built to practice core language fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and clean, state-driven logic.

## About

This repository contains a series of focused JavaScript exercises.
Each exercise is designed to explore one or two core concepts deeply rather than building large, overcomplicated applications.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen fundamentals and build habits that translate well to real-world software development.

## Structure

Each folder represents a standalone exercise or mini-project:

- `part-1-counter/`  
  A counter application with:
  - user-defined step input
  - input validation
  - button enable/disable logic
  - reset functionality

More exercises will be added incrementally, each focusing on a specific concept.

Each exercise folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- a dedicated `README.md` explaining the exercise and concepts used

## Concepts Practiced

Across these exercises, I focus on:

- JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Input validation
- State vs UI separation
- Clean, readable logic
- Avoiding duplicated responsibility in code

---

## How to Run

All projects are built with vanilla JavaScript.

To run any exercise:
1. Open the exercise folder
2. Open `index.html` in a browser

No build tools or dependencies required.

## Notes

These exercises are intentionally small.
The emphasis is on understanding *why* the code works, not just making it work.

Each project is built incrementally, reflecting how features are added and refined in real development workflows.
